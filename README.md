"# LoLB_detect" 
a project that rework "Living-Off-The-Land Command Detection Using Active Learning" article 
  - because of data limitations, 60% data in this project were created by us, there are still some limitations in the data diversity, but the model gives quite good results
  - I won't share the models here because it's too big, you need to retrain the model from the above python files.
*Note: note editing the path when using files
